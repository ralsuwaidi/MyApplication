    <string name="informing_the_angels_about_adam_text">"Allah the Almighty revealed: \n\n\"Remember when your Lord said to the angels: 'Verily, I am going to place mankind generations after generations on earth.' They said: 'Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, while we glorify You with praises and thanks (exalted be You above all that they associate with You as partners) and sanctify You.' Allah said: 'I know that which you do not know.'\n\nAllah taught Adam all the names of everything, then He showed them to the angels and said: \"Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.\" They (angels) said: \"Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise.\" \n\nHe said: \"O Adam! Inform them of their names,\" and when he had informed them of their names, He said: \"Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been hiding?\" \n\nRemember when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourself before Adam\" They prostrated except Iblis, he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers(disobedient to Allah).\"\n\n We said: \"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimeen (wrongdoers).\" Then the Satan made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: \"Get you down all with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.\" \n\nThen Adam received from his Lord Words. His Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the most Merciful. \n\nWe said: \"Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve. But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayah (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, and signs and revelations, etc) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.\" (Chapter 2:30-39, Qur'an).
