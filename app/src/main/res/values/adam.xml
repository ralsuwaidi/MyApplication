    <string name="informing_the_angels_about_adam_text">"Allah the Almighty revealed: \n\n\"Remember when your Lord said to the angels: 'Verily, I am going to place mankind generations after generations on earth.' They said: 'Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, while we glorify You with praises and thanks (exalted be You above all that they associate with You as partners) and sanctify You.' Allah said: 'I know that which you do not know.'\n\nAllah taught Adam all the names of everything, then He showed them to the angels and said: \"Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.\" They (angels) said: \"Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise.\" \n\nHe said: \"O Adam! Inform them of their names,\" and when he had informed them of their names, He said: \"Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been hiding?\" \n\nRemember when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourself before Adam\" They prostrated except Iblis, he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers(disobedient to Allah).\"\n\n We said: \"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimeen (wrongdoers).\" Then the Satan made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: \"Get you down all with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.\" \n\nThen Adam received from his Lord Words. His Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the most Merciful. \n\nWe said: \"Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve. But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayah (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, and signs and revelations, etc) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.\" (Chapter 2:30-39, Qur'an). ""\n\nAlmighty Allah also revealed:\n\n\"And surely, We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the noble shape of a human being), then We told the angels, \"Prostrate to Adam\", and they prostrated, except Iblis, he refused to be those who prostrate. Allah said: \"What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate when I commanded you?\"\n\nIblis said: \"I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire and him You created from clay.\"\n\nAllah said: \"O Iblis get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out for you are of those humiliated and disgraced.\" Iblis said: \"Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (Day of Resurrection).\"\n\nAllah said: \"You are of those allowed respite.\"\n\nIblis said: \"Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your Straight Path. Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (they will not be dutiful to You).\" Allah said: \"Get out from Paradise, disgraced and expelled. Whoever of them (mankind) will follow you, then surely I will fill Hell with you all.\" \"And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the Zalimeen (unjust and wrongdoers).\"\n\n\u201CThen Satan whispered suggestions to them both in order to uncover that which was hidden from them of their private parts before, he said:\" Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels or become of the immortals.\" Satan swore by Allah to them both saying: \"Verily I am one of the sincere well wishes for you both.\"\n\nSo he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to stick together the leaves of Paradise over themselves (in order to cover their shame). Their Lord called out to them saying \"Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you, Verily Satan is an open enemy unto you?\" They said: \"Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.\" Allah said: \"Get down one of you an enemy to the other (i.e. Adam, Eve, and Satan etc). On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment, for a time.\" He said: \"therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be brought out (resurrected).\" (Chapter 7:11-25 Qur'an).\n\nWe imagine when Allah the Almighty decided to create Adam: He addressed His angels and told them to prostrate before him. He did not mean to ask their opinion or take their advice, for He is above that. Allah the Exalted told them that He was going to create a vicegerent on the earth who would have children and grandchildren who would corrupt the earth and shed each other's blood. That is why the angels said to Allah the Almighty: \"Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood!\" (Chapter 2:30 Quran).\n\nThere are old traditions about the angels before the creation of Adam. According to Ibn Qatadah, it was said that the angels were informed about the creation of Adam and his progency by the jinn who lived before Adam. Abdullah Ibn Umar said that the jinn had existed for about 2000 years before Adam and then shed blood. Therefore Allah sent on them an army of angels that drove them out to the depths of the seas.\n\nIbn Abi Hatim narrated from Ali jafar Al Baqer that the angels were informed that man would cause wickedness and shed blood on earth. It was also said that they knew that no one would be created on earth who would not be wicked and shed blood. Whether or not these traditions are correct, the angels did understand that Allah would create a vicegerent on earth. Allah the Almighty announced that HE was going to create a human being out of clay, that HE would mold him and blow His spirit into him and then the angels should prostrate before him. Abi Musa al Sha'arai narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Allah created Adam from a handful of dust taken from different lands, so the children of Adam have been created according to the composition of the land. Therefore from mankind we have white, red, black and yellow ones; we have good and evil, ease and sorrow, and what comes in between them.\" (Sahih al Bukhari).\n\nIbn Masud and other companions of the Prophet (PBUH) said that Allah the Almighty sent Gabriel onto the earth to said that Allah the Almighty sent Gabriel onto the earth to get Him clay therefrom. The earth said: \"I seek refuge in Allah from your decreasing my quantity or disfiguring me.\" So Gabriel returned and did not take anything. He said: \"My Lord, the land sought refuge in You and it granted.\" So Allah sent Michael for the same purpose, and the land sought refuge with Allah and it was granted. So he went back and said to Allah what Gabriel has said before him. Then Allah sent the Angel of Death, and the land sought refuge in Allah, the angel said: \"I also seek refuge with Allah from returning without carrying out His command.\" So he took clay from the face of the earth and mixed it. He did not take from one particular place, but rather he took white, red, and black clay from different places. The Angel of Death ascended with it, Allah soaked the clay till it became sticky. Then Allah said to the angels:\n\n\"Truly, I am going to create man from clay. So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him.\" (Chapter 38:71-72 Quran). So Allah shaped Adam into a human being, but he remained a figure of clay for fourty years. The angels went past him. They were seized with fear by what they saw, and Iblis felt fear most. He used to pass by the figure of Adam, buffeting it, which would make a sound like pottery. Allah told us:\n\n\"He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery.\" (Chapter 55:Quran). When the time drew near to breathe the spirit into Adam, as Allah decreed, He commanded the angels: \"When I breathe My spirit into him prostrate before him.\" Allah breathed His spirit into Adam and when it reached his head Adam sneezed. The angels said: \"Say all praise belongs to Allah.\" Adam repeated: \"All praise belongs to Allah.\" Allah said to him: \"Your Lord has granted you mercy.\" When the spirit reached his eyes, Adam looked at the fruits of Paradise. When it reached his abdomen Adam felt an appetite for food. He jumped hurriedly before the spirit could reach his legs, so that he could eat from the fruits of Paradise. Allah, therefore, said: \"Man is created of haste.\" (Chapter 21:37 Quran).\n\nAnd then:\n\n\"The angels prostrated themselves all of them together. Except Iblis, he refused to be among the prostrators. (Ch 15:31-32 Quran). Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: \"Allah created Adam from dust after He mixed the clay and left him for some time until it became sticky mud, after which Allah shaped him. After that Allah left him till it became like potter's clay. Iblis used to go past him saying 'You have been created for a great purpose.' After that Allah breathed His spirit into him. The first thing into which the spirit passed was his eye and then his nose. He sneezed. Allah said: \"May your Lord have mercy upon you, O Adam! Go to those angels and see what they would say.' So Adam went and greeted them. they replied saying: \"Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of Allah.\" Allah said: \"O Adam! This is your greeting and that of your offspring.\" (Sahih Al Bukhari)."</string>

    <string name="adam_s_progeny_accept_allah_text">"Allah the Almighty revealed:\n\n\"Remember when your Lord brought forth from the children of Adam, from their loins, their seed (or from Adam's loin his offspring) and made them testify as to themselves saying: 'Am I not your Lord?' They said: 'Yes! We testify' lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: 'Verily we have been unaware of this'. Or lest you should say: 'It was only our father aforetime who took others as partners in worship along with Allah and we were merely their descendants after them; will you then destroy us because of the deeds of men who practiced al batil (polytheism) and committing crimes and sins, invoking and worshipping others besides Allah?' Thus do We explain the Ayah (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc) in detail so that they may turn unto the truth\". (Ch 7:172-174 Quran).\n\nAdam's progeny declared: \"Our Lord, we bear witness that You are our Lord; we have no other Lord but Allah. Allah raised their father Adam, and he looked at them and saw those of them who were rich and those who were poor, and those who had good forms and those who did not. Adam said: \"O Allah! I wish You to make Your servants equal.\" Allah replied \"I love being thanked.\" Adam saw among the prophets like lamps among his progeny."</string>

    <string name="the_meaning_of_the_angels_prostration">The Meaning of the Angel\'s Prostration</string>
    <string name="the_meaning_of_the_angels_prostration_text">"Adam opened his eyes and saw all the angels prostrating before him except one being who was standing at a distance Adam did not know what kind of creature it was that did not prostrate before him nor did he know its name. Iblis was standing with the angels so as to be included in the command given to them but he was not one of them. He was a jinn, and as such he was supposed to be inferior to the angels. What is clear is that this prostration was to show respect and did not mean that the angels were worshipping Adam. Prostrating in worship is done only for Allah.. Almighty Allah recounted the story of Iblis's refusal to prostrate before Adam:\n\n\"Remember when your Lord said to the angels, 'I am going to create a man (Adam) from sounding clay of altered black smooth mud. So when I have fashioned him completely and breathed into him (Adam) the soul which I created for him then fall you down prostrating yourselves unto him'. So the angels prostrated themselves all of them together, except Iblis, he refused to be among the prostrators. Allah said: 'O Iblis! What is your reason for not being among the prostrators?' Iblis said: 'I am not the one to prostrate myself to a human being, whom You created from sounding clay of altered black smooth mud.' Allah said: 'Then get out from here for verily you are Rajim (an outcast or cursed one). Verily the curse shall be upon you till Day of Recompense (Day of Resurrection)'\". (Ch 15:28-35 Quran).\n\nIn another surah Almighty Allah recounted it thus: \n\n\"Surely We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the noble shape of a human being), then We told the angels: 'Prostrate to Adam and they prostrated except Iblis he refused to be of those who prostrate\". Allah said: \"What prevented you Iblis that you did not prostrate when I commanded you?\" Iblis said: 'I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire and him You created from clay.' Allah said: 'Get down from this Paradise, it is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out, for you are of those humiliated and disgraced.' Iblis said: 'Allow me respite till the Day of Resurrection).' Allah said: 'You are of those allowed respite.'\" (Ch 7:11-15 Quran). Ibn Jarir reported that Muhammad Ibn sirin said that the first one to reach a conclusion by reasoning was Iblis and that the sun and moon were not worshiped except through this method. This means that Iblis tried to compare himself to Adam. He believed that he was more honorable than Adam. Therefore he abstained from prostrating even though Allah had commanded him to do so, just as He had commanded the angels.\n\nIf an analogy is made we see that Iblis is vain. For indeed clay is better than fire because in it can be found the qualities of calmness, clemency, perseverance and growth; whereas in fire can be found heedlessness, insignificance, haste, and incineration. Iblis tried in vain to justify his refusal:\n\n\"Shall I prostrate to one whom You created from clay?\" Iblis said: \"See? those whom You have honored above me, if You give me respite (keep me alive) to the Day of Resurrection, I will surely seize and mislead his offspring (by sending them astray) all but a few!\" (Ch 17:62 Quran).\n\nAdam was following what was happening around him and had feelings of love, awe, and astonishment. Deep love of Allah,Who had created and glorified him and Who had made His angels prostrate before him. Awe of the Creator's wrath when He excluded Iblis from His mercy. Adam was surprised by this creature, Iblis who abhorred him without even knowing him and who imagined himself better than Adam without having proved that he was worthier. What a strange creature Iblis was, and how strange was his excuse for not prostrating! He imagined that fire is better than clay, but how did he get such an idea? Such knowledge is exclusive to Allah Who created fire and clay and Who knows which is the better of the two. From the dialogue Adam realized that Iblis was a creature characterized by cunning and ingratitude. He then knew that Iblis was his eternal enemy. He was greatly astonished at Iblis's audacity and Allah's tolerance. Immediately after his creation Adam witnessed the large amount of freedom that Allah gives to His commissioned creatures.\n\nAllah knew that Iblis was not going to obey Him in prostrating before Adam. Allah could have totally annihilated him or turned him into a handful of dust or stifled the refusal in his mouth. Yet, Allah gives His commissioned creatures absolute freedom even to the extent that they can refuse Allah the Almighty's commands. He grants them the freedom of denial, disobedience, and even disagreement with Him. His kingdom will not diminish if the disbelievers do not believe in Him nor will it be extended if many people believe in Him. On the contrary, the disbelievers will lose, and the believers will gain but Allah is above all of that.\n\nThere were many traditions about Iblis at the time of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Ibn Masud, Ibn Abbas and a group of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said that Iblis had been the head of the angels in the worldly heavens. Ibn Abbas said in one narration that his name had been Azazil and in another narration he said it had been Al Harith. Ibn Abbas also said that Iblis was a jinn and that they had once been the keepers of Paradise, with Iblis the most honorable and the most learned and the most pious of them. Another tradition says that he had been one of the famous four possessors of wings (angels), before Allah transformed him into the accursed Satan. \n\nAllah Almighty recounts Iblis's disobedience in another surah: \n\n\"Remember when your Lord said to the angels: 'Truly I am going to create man from clay. So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him.' So the angels prostrated themselves all of them; except Iblis, he was proud and was one of the disbelievers.\" Allah said: \"The truth is, and the truth I say, that I will fill Hell with you and those of them (mankind) that follow you together.\" (Ch 38:71-85 Quran)."</string>

    <string name="the_reason_for_adams_creation">The Reason for Adam\'s Creation</string>
    <string name="the_reason_for_adams_creation_text">"After this lesson about freedom Adam learned another lesson, one about knowledge. Adam realized that Iblis was the symbol of evil in the universe and that the angels were the symbol of good. However he did not yet know anything about himself. Then Allah made him perceive his true identity and the reason for his creation, and the secret of his glorification. Allah the Exalted said: \"He taught Adam all the names of everything\". (Ch 2:31 Quran). "</string>

    <string name="teaching_adam">Teaching Adam</string>
    <string name="teaching_adam_text">"Almighty Allah granted Adam the power to know the natures of all things and to summarize them by names; that is a bird, that is a star, that is a tree, etc Allah implanted in Adam an insatiable need for and love of knowledge and a desire to bequeath knowledge to his children. This was the reason for his creation and the secret of his glorification. After Adam had learned the names of all things, along with their properties and uses, Allah presented them to the angels and said:\n\n\"Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.\"(Ch 2:31 Quran) \n\nThe angels admitted their inability:\n\n\"Glory be to You, we have knowledge except what You have taught us. Verily it is You the All Knower, the All Wise.\" (Ch 2:32) \n\nAllah Almighty then turned to Adam: \n\n\"O Adam! Inform them of their names,\" and when he had informed them of their names, He said: 'Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been hiding?'\" (Ch 2:33). \n\nAllah wanted the angels to know that He knew of their astonishment when He had told them about the creation of Adam and that He also knew of their confusion which they had not revealed, as well as what Iblis had concealed of his disobedience and ingratitude. The angels realized that Adam was the creature who knew what they did not know and that his capacity to learn was his noblest quality. His knowledge included knowledge of the Creator which we call faith or Islam, as well as the knowledge he would need to inhabit and master the earth. All kinds of worldly knowledge which are included in this. \n\nAdam knew the names of everything. Sometimes he talked to the angels, but they were preoccupied with worshipping Almighty Allah. Therefore Adam, felt lonely. One day he slept and when he awoke he found near his head, a woman gazing at his face with beautiful tender eyes. The angels asked him her name he replied: \"Eve (Hawa).\" (means living things). They asked: \"Why did you call her Eve?\" Adam said: \"Because she was created of me and I am a living being.\""</string>

    <string name="adam_sees_eve">Adam sees Eve</string>
    <string name="adam_sees_eve_text">"Ibn Abbas and a group of companions of the Prophet (PBUH) narrated that when Iblis was sent out of Paradise and Adam was accommodated therein, Adam was alone in Paradise and did not have a partner from whom he could get tranquility. He slept for some time and when he woke up, he saw a woman whom Allah had created from his ribs. So he asked her, \"Who are you? She replied, \"A woman\" He asked: \"Why have you been created?\" She said :\"So that you could find tranquility in me.\" The angels, trying to find out the extent of his knowledge, asked him: \"What is her name, O Adam?\" He replied, \"Eve\". They asked: \"Why was she so named?\" He replied, \" Because she was created from something living.\""</string>
